    "[5 points] (mostly the same processes as from previous lab) Explain the task and what business-case or use-case it is designed to solve (or designed to investigate). Detail exactly what the task is and what parties would be interested in the results. How well would your prediction algorithm need to perform to be considered useful by interested parties?\n",
    "[10 points] (mostly the same processes as from lab one) Define and prepare your class variables. Use proper variable representations (int, float, one-hot, etc.). Use pre-processing methods (as needed) for dimensionality reduction, scaling, etc. Remove variables that are not needed/useful for the analysis. Describe the final dataset that is used for classification (include a description of any newly formed variables you created).\n",

    "\n",
    "### Evaluation (30 points total)\n",
    "\n",
    "[15 points] Choose and explain what metric(s) you will use to evaluate your algorithm’s generalization performance. You should give a detailed argument for why this (these) metric(s) are appropriate on your data. That is, why does the metric evaluate performance in terms of the business case you argued for. Please note: rarely is accuracy the best evaluation metric to use. \n",
    "Think deeply about an appropriate measure of performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "[15 points] Choose the method you will use for dividing your data into training and testing (i.e., are you using Stratified 10-fold cross validation? Why?). Explain why your chosen method is appropriate or use more than one method as appropriate. For example, if you are using time series data then you should be using continuous training and testing sets across time. Convince the reader that your cross validation method is a realistic mirroring of how an algorithm would be used in practice. \n",
    "\n",
    "Important: You should use your chosen evaluation criteria and chosen method for dividing train/test data throughout the report. For example, arguing that f-score is the best evaluation method, but then using accuracy in a grid search will be regarded as a conceptual error and graded accordingly. \n",

    "    When instantiated, use a selectable phi function for the initial layer: either sigmoid or linear \n",
    "    Use a selectable cost function when instantiated: either quadratic or cross entropy\n",
    "    Add support for any number of hidden layers (user customizable).\n",
    "\n",
    "[15 points] Tune the hyper-parameters of your MLP model (phi function, objective function, and number of layers). While tuning hyper-parameters, analyze the results using your chosen metric(s) of evaluation. Visualize the evaluation metric(s) versus the hyper-parameters. Conclude what combination of parameters are best.\n",
    "\n",
    "[10 points] Visualize the magnitude of the gradients in each layer of the neural network versus the training iteration. Do the gradients stay consistent in each layer?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exceptional Work (10 points total)\n",
    "\n",
    "You have free reign to provide additional analyses.\n",
    "One idea (required for 7000 level students):  Implement two more phi functions: ReLU and SiLU (also called Swish). Compare their performance to the linear and sigmoid phi functions. \n"

    "In this lab, we investigate possible relationships between an individual's income and attributes about them. The data used in this lab is provided by the 2009 American Community Survey 1-Year PUMS Population File which can be found here. https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/2009-american-community-survey-1-year-pums-population-file. This dataset contains more than 3 million entries and nearly 300 attributes. To make sense of some of these attributes, there is a dictionary lookup that provides more information about the columns. You can find this reference here. https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/tech_docs/pums/data_dict/PUMSDataDict09.pdf.\n",

For example, their age, sex, education level, and more are just a few peices of information that companies may ask for when applying for a new job. \n",
    "\n",
    "This information could be incrediably useful for a company that is hiring new personal. If they know the current income of someone who has applied for a job at their company, then they can offer the lowest starting salary they believe the new canadate will accept. (i.e. slightly above what they currently make). \n",
    "\n",
    "Since my overall goal is considered difficult as it is to accurately determine a person's income, I've decided that I will try to determine a person's income bracket instead. This is a good starting point as there are much less classes to predict. Initially I will start with 5 income brackets. Although this information is less useful than my original goal, it still could help companies with low-balling initial offers to employees. \n"

    "Since my goal is to accurately determine an individual's income bracket (and offer a salary slightly above what they currently make), I need to use an appropriate metric for evaluating the classifier. In this specific senerio, there is only one case where I could deem this a successful classifier, as the model correctly picks the right income bracket.\n",

On the other hand, if the model predicts a bracket greater than the actual bracket than the company would offer way more money than neccessary. \n",

    "I've decided to use F-score as my metric for scoring the predictive model. F-Score uses a combination of both Recall and Precision. \n",

    "##### Recall \n",
    "A good recall is the ability to mark as many of the income brackets as the desired income bracket. For example, if we were looking for the middle income bracket a good recall would mark as many of them in the middle income bracket as possible. Furthermore, a perfect recall model, when given a class, will identify every individual who is in the middle income bracket as a middle income bracket individual. However, it should be noted that this does not mean that every class that is marked as a middle income bracket individual is actually a middle income bracket individual. This metric is specifically focused and conerned with reducing false negatives.\n",

    "##### Precision\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision compliments recall as it concerns whether the classifier was correct or not. For example, a model with high precision on a certain class will be accurate when it claims that a test case is of that class. Perfect precision means you can trust that the model knows when a \"duck is a duck\". However, precision does not concern itself with ensuring that it identifies all the classes correctly. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, good precision is the abillity for the model to be correct when it claims an individual is in this specific bracket. It is not concerned with catching all individuals in a specific bracket, only that when it determines a individual is a specific bracket, it is correct. \n",
